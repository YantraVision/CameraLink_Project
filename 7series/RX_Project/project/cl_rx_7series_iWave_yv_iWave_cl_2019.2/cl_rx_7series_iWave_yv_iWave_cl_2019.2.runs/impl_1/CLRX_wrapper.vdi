WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net CLRX_i/YV_CL_RX_TOP_0/inst/yv_cl_rx_top_enc/YV_TOP/hash_dna/inst/DNA_i/FSM_sequential_NEXT_STATE_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CLRX_i/YV_CL_RX_TOP_0/inst/yv_cl_rx_top_enc/YV_TOP/hash_dna/inst/DNA_i/FSM_sequential_NEXT_STATE_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell CLRX_i/YV_CL_RX_TOP_0/inst/yv_cl_rx_top_enc/YV_TOP/hash_dna/inst/DNA_i/FSM_sequential_NEXT_STATE_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
